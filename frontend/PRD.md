### **1. Introduction & Vision**

CalorieQuest is a user-centric web application designed to empower individuals to take control of their nutritional health. The core vision is to transform the often tedious task of calorie tracking into an engaging and motivating personal journey. By framing health objectives as a "Quest"—a specific mission or a goal—we aim to help users build sustainable, healthy eating habits and achieve their personal wellness targets, whether that's weight loss, muscle gain, or maintaining a balanced diet.

### **2. Problem Statement**

Many people struggle to achieve their health and fitness goals due to a lack of consistency and awareness regarding their daily food intake. Existing tools can be complex, time-consuming, or fail to keep users motivated over the long term. This leads to users abandoning their tracking efforts and, consequently, failing to reach their health objectives. There is a need for a straightforward, efficient, and encouraging platform that simplifies nutrition tracking and helps users stay committed to their personal health journey.

### **3. Target Audience**

*   **Health-Conscious Individuals:** Users who are actively looking to improve their diet, lose weight, or maintain their current physique.
*   **Fitness Enthusiasts:** Individuals who need to track macronutrients and calories to support their training regimens, such as muscle gain or performance optimization.
*   **Beginners in Nutrition:** People who are new to tracking their food intake and need a simple, intuitive tool to get started and learn about their eating habits.

### **4. Goals & Objectives**

The primary goal of CalorieQuest is to help users build healthy eating habits and achieve personal targets through consistent calorie and nutrient tracking.

**User Goals:**
*   To easily and quickly log daily food consumption.
*   To understand their daily calorie and nutrient intake against a set target.
*   To feel motivated and see clear progress toward their health "Quest."

**Product Goals:**
*   **Engagement:** Frame calorie tracking as a personal "Quest" to improve user motivation and long-term retention.
*   **Efficiency:** Provide a fast and flexible food logging system that minimizes user effort.
*   **Clarity:** Offer a clear and simple dashboard that visualizes daily progress and historical trends.
*   **Adoption:** Achieve a high rate of daily active users who successfully log their meals for at least four days a week.

### **5. Features & Requirements**

#### **5.1. User Onboarding & Quest Setup**
*   **Description:** A guided setup process for new users to create their profile and define their personal health "Quest."
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a new user, I want to sign up for an account using my email and password.
    *   As a new user, I want to input my personal data (age, gender, height, weight, activity level) to calculate my recommended daily calorie target.
    *   As a new user, I want to select my primary goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintain weight) which will define my "Quest."

#### **5.2. Daily Food Logging**
*   **Description:** The core functionality allowing users to log the food they consume. The system must be flexible to accommodate different user preferences for data entry.
*   **Requirements & User Stories:**
    *   **Log via Search:**
        *   As a user, I want to search for a food item from a comprehensive food database to quickly log it.
        *   The search results should display common serving sizes and corresponding calorie information.
    *   **Log Manually:**
        *   As a user, I want to manually enter a food item if I cannot find it in the database.
        *   Each manual entry must allow me to input the **food name, quantity (e.g., grams, oz, serving), and total calories**.
    *   **Log from History:**
        *   As a user, I want to view a list of my recently logged items so I can quickly log foods I eat frequently.
        *   As a user, I want to be able to save foods as "Favorites" for even faster access.

#### **5.3. Dashboard & Progress Tracking**
*   **Description:** A central dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of the user's daily progress toward their "Quest."
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to see a real-time summary of my total calories consumed for the day.
    *   As a user, I want to see my daily calorie target and a visual representation (e.g., a progress bar) of how close I am to meeting it.
    *   As a user, I want to view a list of all the food items I have logged for the current day.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to easily edit or delete a food entry from my daily log.

### **6. User Flow**

1.  **Sign-Up/Login:** User creates an account or logs in.
2.  **Onboarding:** New user sets up their profile and defines their "Quest" (goal).
3.  **Dashboard:** User lands on the main dashboard, showing today's progress (initially at zero).
4.  **Log Food:**
    *   User clicks "Add Food."
    *   User chooses a logging method: **Search**, **Manual Entry**, or selects from **Recent/Favorites**.
    *   User confirms the food item and quantity.
5.  **View Progress:** The dashboard updates instantly with the new entry, reflecting the change in total calories consumed.
6.  **End of Day:** User reviews their daily summary to see if they met their goal.

### **9. Out of Scope (Future Work)**

*   Recipe import and analysis.
*   Social features (sharing progress, friend leaderboards).
*   Integration with fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch).
*   Native iOS and Android applications.
